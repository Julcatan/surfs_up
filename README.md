## Overview of the analysis: 

_The purpose of the analysis is to evaluate if the planned investment for an ice cream shop in Oahu is sustainable year-round. In order to determine this
we specifically look at temperature data for the months of June and December._

## Results: 


### Major points derived from the analysis
  
  - The average temperature is 71°F in December and 74°F in June.
  - The minimum temperature in December with 56°F is 8 degrees lower than the temperature in June with 64°F. The maximum temperature is 2 degrees lower with 83°F in December   versus 85°F in June. 
  - Only 25% of the temperatures are at or under 69°F for December and 73°F in June. 
  - 75% of the temperatures are at or above 74°F for December and 77°F in June.

Summary: 

The temperatures in Oahu are very similar is very similar with average temperatures in the low 70s.


and is suitable for a surf/ice cream shop.
The variance in temperatures make it easy to plan. Because this analysis only looks at the temperatures, I would recommend additional analysis of some other data points e.g. 

- precipitation and ....

- 


Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.




For this part of the Challenge, write a report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.
