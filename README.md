This repository includes a climate analysis for an investment in a surf/ ice cream shop. 

Software used:
Jupyter Notebook
Python
SQL Lite

## Overview of the analysis: 

_The purpose of the analysis is to evaluate if the planned investment for an ice cream shop in Oahu is sustainable year-round. In order to determine this additional information 
we specifically look at temperature data for the months of June and December._

## Results: 


### Three major points can be derived from the analysis
  
  - The average temperature is very similar in the low 70s , between 71 F in December and 74 F in June
  - The minimum temperature in December with 56 F is 8 degrees lower than the temperature in June with 64  
  - The maximum temperature is 83 in December and 85 in June 
  - Standard Deviation...3.745 in Dec vs 3.257 June_  
  - the ...Quartile of the temperatures are in the 74 degree range

Summary: 

The climate in Oahu is very similar in June and December and is suitable for a surf/ice cream shop.
The variance in temperatures make it easy to plan. Because this analysis only looks at the temperatures, I would recommend additional analysis of some other data points e.g. 

- precipitation and ....

- 


Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.




For this part of the Challenge, write a report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.
