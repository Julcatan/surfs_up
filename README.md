This repository includes a climate analysis for a surf shop investment 

Software used:
Jupyter Notebook
Python
SQL Lite

Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of the analysis is to evaluate if the planned investment for an ice cream shop in Oahu is sustainable year-round. In order to determine this additional information 
we specifically look at temperature data for the months of June and December.

Results: 


Three major points can be derived from the analysis
  
  - The average temperature is very similar in the low 70s , between 71 F in December and 74 F in June
  - The minimum temperature in December with 56 F is 8 degrees lower than the temperature in June with 64  
  - The maximum temperature is 83 in December and 85 in June 


Summary: 

Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.




For this part of the Challenge, write a report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.
